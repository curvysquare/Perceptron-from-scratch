## Description: 
- The perceptron is used within a supervised learning context to learn the weight and bias parameters that correctly classifiy positive and negative classes.
- See report for the details on perceptron technicalities and pesudo-code.
- Test Accuracies and confusion matrix are reported.
- Deployed in a one-vs-rest approach (training a binary for perceptron for each class on a dataset where its class is the positive class label and all other classes have a negative class label).
